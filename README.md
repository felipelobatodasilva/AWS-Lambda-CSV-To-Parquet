[__Lambda__](https://www.dynatrace.com/news/blog/what-is-aws-lambda-2/) -> What is AWS Lambda?
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that can run code in response to predetermined events or conditions and automatically manage all the computing resources required for those processes. It also enables DevOps teams to connect to any number of AWS services or run their own functions.
